# Issues and Solutions Log

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Issue 1: "503: Failed to connect to device" Error**
**Problem:** Device shows as "not found in capabilities" when trying to connect
**Root Cause:** Device had `agent_id = NULL` in database, causing fallback to local Appium discovery on cloud server
**Solution:** 
- Created `device_fix.py` router with force-connect endpoints
- Direct database manipulation to set `agent_id` and `platform`
- Mock agent creation for orphaned devices
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 2: CORS Policy Blocking Frontend**
**Problem:** `Access to fetch at 'https://fsn-system-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/accounts' from origin 'https://fsndevelopment.com' has been blocked by CORS policy`
**Root Cause:** Backend CORS configuration too restrictive
**Solution:**
- Updated `api/main.py` to use `allow_origins=["*"]` and `allow_credentials=False`
- Added `https://www.fsndevelopment.com` to allowed origins
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 3: Frontend Calling Non-Existent Endpoints**
**Problem:** Frontend calling `/connect` and `/disconnect` but backend only had `/start` and `/stop`
**Root Cause:** API endpoint mismatch between frontend and backend
**Solution:**
- Added alias endpoints `/connect` and `/disconnect` in `api/routes/devices.py`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 4: Mac .sh Files Opening in Xcode**
**Problem:** Double-clicking `.sh` files opened in Xcode instead of Terminal
**Root Cause:** macOS file association issue
**Solution:**
- Created `.command` files that open in Terminal
- Created `.app` bundle for proper Mac application
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üîß **TECHNICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Issue 5: Git Push Rejected (Non-Fast-Forward)**
**Problem:** `! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)`
**Root Cause:** Remote contained work not present locally
**Solution:**
- Performed `git pull` to fetch remote changes
- Resolved merge conflicts by accepting local changes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 6: npm install Failed for ngrok**
**Problem:** `npm error notarget No matching version found for ngrok@^5.0.0`
**Root Cause:** ngrok version 5.0.0 doesn't exist
**Solution:**
- Downgraded ngrok to `^4.3.3` in `package.json`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 7: Local Agent Config Corruption**
**Problem:** `LOG_LEVEL` in `config.js` contained error message instead of log level
**Root Cause:** File corruption during editing
**Solution:**
- Manually corrected `config.js` to proper format
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Issue 8: Windows PowerShell Compatibility**
**Problem:** `curl` command not available on Windows for Appium status check
**Root Cause:** Windows doesn't have curl by default
**Solution:**
- Modified `agent.js` to use PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üö´ **CURRENT ISSUES (Not Yet Resolved)**

### **Issue 9: Missing Agent Pairing System**
**Problem:** No way for users to pair their Mac agent with their license
**Impact:** Users can't connect their devices to the system
**Priority:** HIGH
**Solution Needed:**
- QR code generation for pairing
- Token exchange system
- Agent pairing UI in frontend

### **Issue 10: No Tunnel Creation**
**Problem:** Agent can't create secure tunnels to expose local Appium
**Impact:** Backend can't reach local devices
**Priority:** HIGH
**Solution Needed:**
- Cloudflared integration
- Ngrok fallback option
- Public URL registration

### **Issue 11: No Job Execution Engine**
**Problem:** No system to execute posting/warmup jobs on devices
**Impact:** Users can't actually use the system for automation
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Solution Needed:**
- Template system for jobs
- Job execution engine
- Progress tracking

### **Issue 12: No Frontend Integration**
**Problem:** Frontend doesn't have UI for device management or job control
**Impact:** Users can't manage devices or start jobs
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Solution Needed:**
- Device management UI
- Running page with job controls
- Template management interface
